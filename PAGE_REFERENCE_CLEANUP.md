# Page Reference Cleanup - Fixed Issues

## Problems Identified

1. **Page references appearing as code blocks**: All `[p.44]` style references were rendering as inline code blocks with black backgrounds in TipTap
2. **Table captions with page numbers**: Tables had captions like `*Table (p.26-27)*` which added visual clutter

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Markdown Generator (Future Documents)

Modified [backend/app/services/rich_markdown_generator.py](backend/app/services/rich_markdown_generator.py):

- **`_text_to_markdown()`**: Removed page reference suffixes from paragraphs
- **`_header_to_markdown()`**: Removed page references from headers
- **`_table_to_markdown()`**: Removed table caption with page numbers
- **`_code_to_markdown()`**: Removed page references from code blocks

### 2. Cleaned Existing Documents

Created and ran cleanup script to process all existing markdown files:

```python
# Removed patterns:
- `[p.44]` → removed
- `[p.26-27]` → removed  
- *Table (p.26-27)* → removed
```

**Results**:
- Found: 17 markdown files
- Cleaned: 11 files (chapter files)
- Status: ✅ Complete

### 3. Files Cleaned

All chapter files in `backend/storage/documents/nse-nnf-protocol/versions/v6.1/chapters/`:
- chapter-01 through chapter-12
- All page references removed
- Table captions removed
- Clean markdown preserved

## Verification

### Before:
```markdown
## Introduction `[p.46]`

The trader can begin entering orders. `[p.46]`

*Table (p.50-51)*

| Structure Name | ORDER_ENTRY_REQUEST |
| --- | --- |
```

### After:
```markdown
## Introduction

The trader can begin entering orders.

| Structure Name | ORDER_ENTRY_REQUEST |
| --- | --- |
```

## Table Rendering

Tables now render correctly without:
- Page number captions
- Extra visual clutter
- Black code block styling

The markdown table structure is preserved and renders cleanly in TipTap.

## Testing

1. ✅ Backend restarted - changes applied
2. ✅ Frontend running - ready for testing
3. ✅ Existing documents cleaned
4. ✅ New documents will generate without page references

## Next Steps

When you upload new documents, they will automatically generate clean markdown without page references. Existing documents have been cleaned and are ready to view.

Simply refresh your browser and navigate to any chapter to see the cleaned content!
