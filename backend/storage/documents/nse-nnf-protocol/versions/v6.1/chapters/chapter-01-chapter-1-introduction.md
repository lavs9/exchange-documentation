# Chapter 1 Introduction


The National  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Ltd  (NSEIL)  provides  a  fully  automated  screen  based trading system, enabling trading members spread across the length and breadth of India to trade directly  from  their  offices  through  an  extensive  telecommunication  network.  The  system  is known as 'National Exchange for Automated Trading' (NEAT) system. It adopts the principles of an order driven market, based on price-time priority. The trading members can use NEAT Front end or Non-NEAT Front end (NNF) to establish a network connection with the host system of National Stock Exchange (NSE) for trading. NNF is a front end which is developed and maintained by vendors other than NSE. NSE provides the NNF users with the general guideline document of the front end whereas they are supported by their respective vendors and NSE is not responsible for the performance of the NNF.
