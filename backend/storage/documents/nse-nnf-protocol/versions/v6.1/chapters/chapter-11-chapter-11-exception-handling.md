# Chapter 11 Exception Handling


## Introduction `[p.165]`

NSE's trading system constitutes of multiple matching engines (streams). Each stream hosts a range of contracts on which trading is allowed. In case of an exception single/multiple streams will get impacted. It is necessary that relevant information is disseminated in such events so that necessary action can be taken at member's end to bring their systems into a consistent state. Exception handling: `[p.165]`

- At the start of the outage message will be sent on broadcast channel with StreamNumber and status as 1 (start of outage) and members may get disconnected from the exchange (Member can also receive this message through journal download).
- On receiving message in step 1, members should clear outstanding orders at their end for the respective streams. Exchange would also cancel all the outstanding orders and no cancellation messages will be sent for these orders.
- Once exchange has restored the stream, message will be sent on broadcast channel with StreamNumber and status as 0 (end of outage) (Member can also receive this message through journal download).
- On receiving the message in step 3, Members can reconnect to the exchange in case they have got disconnected in step 1.
