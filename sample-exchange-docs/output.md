## Chapter 1 Introduction

The National  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Ltd  (NSEIL)  provides  a  fully  automated  screen  based trading system, enabling trading members spread across the length and breadth of India to trade directly  from  their  offices  through  an  extensive  telecommunication  network.  The  system  is known as 'National Exchange for Automated Trading' (NEAT) system. It adopts the principles of an order driven market, based on price-time priority. The trading members can use NEAT Front end or Non-NEAT Front end (NNF) to establish a network connection with the host system of National Stock Exchange (NSE) for trading. NNF is a front end which is developed and maintained by vendors other than NSE. NSE provides the NNF users with the general guideline document of the front end whereas they are supported by their respective vendors and NSE is not responsible for the performance of the NNF.

## Chapter 2 General Guidelines

## Introduction

This chapter provides general guidelines for the designers and programmers who develop NNF. It also provides information on data types and their size which can help in understanding various structures.

## Message Structure Details

The message structure consists of two parts namely message header and message data. The message header consists of the fields of the header which is prefaced with all the structures.

The message data consists of the actual data that is sent across to the trading system (i.e. host) or received from the trading system (i.e. host).

Transaction code, an important field of the message header, is a unique numeric identifier which is sent to or received from the trading system. This is used to identify the transaction between the TWS and the host end.

## Guidelines for Designers

1. The order of the log-on messages should strictly be maintained as given in the following section (Chapter 3) of the document. Otherwise, the user cannot log on to the trading system.
2. All time fields are number of seconds from midnight January 1, 1980.
3. No host-end inquiries are permitted for NNF users.
4. All price fields must be multiplied by 100 before sending to the host end and divided by 100 while receiving from the host end as the host system processes prices in paisa.
5. All  branch/user/order  value  limit  fields  must  be  multiplied  by  (100000  *  100)  before sending to host end and divided by (100000 * 100) while receiving from the host end as the host system processes limits in paisa.

## Guidelines for Programmers

1. If your system uses little-endian order, the data types such as UINT, SHORT, LONG and DOUBLE contained in a packet, which occupy more than one byte should be twiddled (byte reversed). Twiddling involves reversing a given number of bytes such that the byte

in 'n' position comes to the first position; the byte in (n -1) position comes to the second position and so on. For example, if the value to be sent is 1A2B (hexadecimal), reverse the bytes to 2B1A. The same applies while receiving messages. So if the value received is 02BC, the actual value is BC02. So twiddle such data types before sending and after receiving to ensure that correct data is sent and received.

## Note:

Twiddling is required because of the variety in endian order -big and little. A big-endian representation has a multi-byte integer written with its most significant byte on the left. A little-endian representation, on the other hand, places the most significant byte on the right. The trading system host end uses big-endian order.

2. All alphabetical data must be converted to upper case except password before sending to the host. A combination of alphabet, numbers and special characters are allowed in the  password. More  details  on  password  are  explained  in  later  chapters  in  this document. No NULL terminated strings should be sent to the host end. Instead, fill it with blanks before  sending.  The  strings  received  from  the  host  end  are  padded  with blanks and are not NULL terminated.
3. All the structures should be defined in the following manner:
- Items of type char or unsigned char, or arrays containing items of these types, are byte aligned.
- Structures are word aligned.
- All other types of structure members are word aligned.
- All structures are pragma pack 2. Structures of odd size should be padded to an even number of bytes.
4. All numeric data must be set to zero (0) before sending to the host, unless a value is assigned to it.
5. All reserved fields mentioned, should be mapped to CHAR buffer and initialized to NULL.
6. Inside the broadcast packet, the first byte indicates the market type.  Ignore the next 7 bytes. If the first byte is 2 it indicates Futures &amp; Options market. The message header starts from the 9th byte. The remaining portion of the buffer has to be mapped to the broadcast structures mentioned in the document.

## Note:

- The values of all the constants and transaction codes given in the document are listed in Appendix.
- The suffix IN in the transaction codes implies that the request is sent from the TWS to the host end whereas OUT implies that the message is sent from the host end to TWS

## Data Types Used

| Data Type     | Size of Bytes   | Signed / Unsigned         |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| CHAR          | 1               | Signed                    |
| UINT          | 2               | Unsigned                  |
| SHORT         | 2               | Signed                    |
| LONG          | 4               | Signed                    |
| UNSIGNED LONG | 4               | Unsigned                  |
| LONG LONG     | 8               | Signed                    |

| BIT           | 1 bit           | NA                        |

## Message Header

Each structure is prefaced with a MESSAGE\_HEADER which is an interactive header. Some data in the header are fixed whereas some data are variable and set differently for each transaction code. The structure of the Message Header is as follows:

Table 1 MESSAGE HEADER

| Structure Name   | MESSAGE_HEADER   | MESSAGE_HEADER   | MESSAGE_HEADER   |

## Invalid Message Length Response Transcode

If a user sends a request with improper message length, then the host will send INVALID\_MSG\_LENGTH\_RESPONSE transcode (2322) in response. This check is not specific to the type of user and may occur for both NEAT and NNF Users.

Message length may vary from one request to the other. For example, for an Order request the Host end expects a request with the message length of 214 bytes. If the order request has any message length other than 214 bytes, it will send the above mentioned transcode with the error code -ERR\_INVALID\_MSG\_LENGTH (defined in the error codes table previously). Host sends the same incoming packet structure in response but with transcode populated as

INVALID\_MSG\_LENGTH\_RESPONSE (2322) and error code populated as ERR\_INVALID\_MSG\_LENGTH.

Kindly refer to individual transocde for their corresponding message length

## Communication Network Connections for NNF Users

There are two types of virtual circuit connections used to communicate with the host end. One is the Interactive Virtual Circuit ID (VCID) and the other is the Broadcast Circuit ID (BCID).

Interactive VCID follows a bidirectional path between the NNF and NEAT to host end. All the interactive / request messages and its respective response follow through this channel. Even the unsolicited  message  such  as  trade  message  flows  from  exchange  (host  end)  to  the  trader terminal through this channel.

Standard implementation of TCP/IP protocol exists on the exchange's infrastructure as a result of which default features like IP fragmentation, no QoS etc. continue to be enabled and available for use by members. Default IP fragmentation a valid feature in the TCP/IP protocol works at message  level  and  usage  of  same  by  one  member  connection  will  not  block  or  impact  the messages of other member connections.

BCID  follows  a  unidirectional  path  which  is  from  the  host  end  to  the  NFF  /  NEAT.  All  the broadcast  data  are  transmitted  through  this  broadcast  circuit  from  the  host  end  for  all  the traders. Since this is a one way connection, the data flow is always from the exchange (host end) to the trader terminal.

## Member Guide to the Gateway Router Functionality

Currently Exchange publishes a list of gateway servers (NET) in the respective segments to which members can connect. Members have the choice of connecting to any of the gateway servers.

However,  the  members  have  represented  that  they  are  required  to  try  to  login  on  multiple gateway  server  sequentially  before  they  are  able  to  successfully  login  on  the  Exchange  for trading activity. Thus, valuable time is lost by the member for trying to access the Exchange. The same is more severe during re-login / disconnections faced by the members.

In order to address these queries the Gateway Router Functionality has been proposed to be implemented.

1. It  is  now  proposed  that  members will  first  connect  to  a  gateway  router  server  in  the respective segment details of which will be published by the Exchange.
2. The gateway router server will decide which gateway server is available for the member and will accordingly provide the details of the allocated gateway server to the member through the response message.
3. After getting the response message the member will need to connect to the allocated gateway server.

Thus,  the  process  of  allocating  gateway  servers  becomes  Exchange  determined  and  highly simplified for the member.

The gateway router will decide the gateway server for the member for each trading day in the following manner:

1. The gateway router will maintain the used capacity of each gateway server. The gateway router will allocate least used gateway server (according to capacity). The capacity is based on the no. of messages allotted for each Box Id.
2. If all gateway servers have similar used capacity then a gateway server will be randomly allocated by the gateway router server.
3. Once a member has been provided session key with gateway server details by gateway router server, the member is expected to connect and login to the allocated gateway server at any time during rest of the trading day.
4. If the member gets logged off from the allocated gateway server, then the member has to request the gateway router server for getting new session key and gateway server details.

5. A member will be directed to the same gateway server by the gateway router server, once it has been allocated for the trading day.
6. Though the user will get directed to the same gateway, the user must ask the gateway router  for  getting  the  gateway  details  and  session  key  as  the  old  session  key  will  be unique for that particular session and is cleaned up from the gateway once the user gets logged off.
7. Also, if the gateway has a failure during the day, the user will be allocated a new gateway server. This will be done transparently for the user by the gateway router server.

At the end of each trading day the gateway router server will clean up the used capacity, and will have the same capacity (full capacity) available for all gateway servers for the next day.

## Chapter 3 Logon Process

## Introduction

This section describes how a trader logs on to the trading system. It covers the log-on request and the system responses. This section also describes the download of the updated information on the securities, participants, and the status of the markets. It covers the structures and field descriptions  of  System  Information  Download,  Local  Database  Download  and  Message Download.

The process by which a trader logs on to the trading system is called Logon Process. The trader, after  issuing  a  sign-on  request,  waits  for  the  system  response.  The  response  could  be  a successful logon or an error message.

## Message Download Changes

- Messages will be sent through various streams (at The Exchange). The stream number will be sent in the TimeStamp2 field of the message header.
- The total number of streams from the Exchange will be specified in the first byte of alpha char field (alpha char is of 2 bytes) of the header section of SYSTEM\_INFORMATION\_OUT (1601) message. Streams are numbered starting from 1. E.g.: If the value in the alpha char field is 4, total number of streams from the Exchange is 4 and the stream numbers will be 1,2,3,4.
- The mechanism for message download request has changed, Message downloads will now be served through each individual stream . Hence, message download request needs to be sent individually for a stream by the user.
- In the message download request (Transcode 7000), first byte of alpha char field of the header section should contain the stream number for which the message download is required. If the stream no. sent in the request is invalid then exchange will drop the request. The Sequence number field must contain the sequence number value for that particular stream.
- The response of the request will be sent individually through the specified stream starting from the next sequence number specified in the request. Message download from each stream will have header, data and trailer section (same as existing format).
- o Header -This is to indicate that message download is going to commence. The first byte of alpha char field of header will contain the stream number.

<!-- image -->

- o Data -The data is wrapped in another structure. The outer header indicates that this message is a part of the Message Download Data. The inner header indicates the type of data received. The first byte of alpha char field of outer header will contain the stream number.
- o Trailer -This indicates that message download is complete. The first byte of alpha char field of header will contain the stream number.
- Message download request can be made for one or more streams. It is recommended that the user requests download for all the streams.
- If the sequence number in the request is 0, then all messages for that stream will be sent. To get incremental download for any particular stream, the message download request must contain the last sequence number received from that stream.

## Note:

1. Structure for message download request is not changed.
2. Structure for message download response is not changed.

## Order of Events to Be Followed During Logon and Logoff

The following sequence explains the order in which transaction codes are sent and received during log-on process.

|   Sequence No | Transaction Code              | Sent By   | Received By   |

The following sequence explains the order in which the transaction codes are sent and received during log-off process.

|   Sequence No | Transaction Code            | Sent By   | Received By   |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------|---------------|
|             1 | SIGN_OFF_REQUEST_IN (2320)  | TWS       | Host End      |
|             2 | SIGN_OFF_REQUEST_OUT (2321) | Host End  | TWS           |

## Logon Request

When the user wants to establish an interactive circuit with the host, he sends this request.

Eligibility  for  the  broker  to  participate  in  the  CALL  AUCTION  2  Market  is  being  used.  In SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_IN, one  bit  from  the  existing  reserved  bit  in  BrokerEligibilityPerMarket structure is getting re-used for CALL AUCTION 2 market eligibility.

In the request packet sent from TWS to the Exchange, the value for these bits must be set to numerical  zero,  similar  to  other  Market  eligibility  bits,  The  modified  structure  as  per  above change is given below.

This is returned if the market status sent in the UPDATE\_LOCALDB\_IN message is not the same at the host end or the symbols (securities) are opening. In this case the market status at the host end is sent back in the MARKET STATUS as 'wait till markets are open ' . The following structure is returned:

SYSTEM INFORMATION DATA (Refer to System Information Response in Chapter 3)

| Field Name      | Brief Description                                          |

| TransactionCode | The transaction code is PARTIAL_SYSTEM_INFORMATION (7321). |
| MarketStatus    | This contains the latest market status.                    |

## Update Local Database Download

The  download  comprises  of  a  header,  data  and  the  trailer.  Each  updated  security  status, participant (if selected) and GTC/GTD order will be sent as a separate message. As of now GTC and GTD facilities are not allowed hence there will be no download for GTC and GTD orders.

## Update Local Database Header

This is sent only to indicate that a sign-on download is going to commence. There is no additional data sent. The header is sent in the following format:

## Chapter 4

## Introduction

This  section  describes  about  entering  new  orders,  modifying  existing  orders,  and  canceling outstanding orders. The trader can begin entering the orders once he has logged on to the trading system and the market is in pre-open or open state.

Please note this section is referenced in CM\_DROP\_COPY\_PROTOCOL document. Any change here may also impact the Order Drop Copy functionality

## Order Entry

Order entry allows the trader to place orders in the market. The system accepts the orders from the users and tries to match the orders with the orders in the books immediately. If the order does not match, the order is placed in the appropriate book with the price and time stamp.

## NOTE:

When market status is pre-open, order entry request will be accepted only if pre-open indicator is set as '1', else orders will be rejected.

## Order Types

## Regular Lot

Regular  Lot  Orders  are  orders  in  the  normal  market  that  have  none  of  the  following  terms attached:      All Or None, Minimum Fill and Trigger Price.

Thereafter, for every response the trading system will return this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Volume            | This field should specify the quantity of the order placed. The quantity should always be in multiples of Regular Lot except for Odd Lot orders, and be less than the issued capital. The order will go for a freeze if the quantity is greater than the freeze quantity determined by NSE-Control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Price             | This field should contain the price at which the order is placed. To enter a Market order, the price should be zero. The price must be a multiple of the tick size. For Stop Loss orders, the limit price must be greater than the trigger price in case of a Buy order and less if it is a Sell order. This is to be multiplied by 100 before sending to the trading system host.                                                                                                                                                           |
| TriggerPrice      | This field is applicable only for a Stop Loss order and should be a multiple of the tick size. This field should contain the price at which the order is to be triggered and brought to the market. For a Stop Loss buy order, the trigger price will be less than or equal to the limit price but greater than the last traded price. For a Stop Loss sell order, the trigger price will be greater than or equal to the limit price but less than the last traded price. This is to be multiplied by 100 before sending to trading system. |
| GoodTillDate      | This field should contain the number of days for a GTD order. This field may be set in two ways. To specify an absolute date set this field to that date in number of seconds since midnight of January 1, 1980. To specify days set this to the number of days. This can take values from 2 to the maximum days specified for GTC orders only. If this field is non-zero, the GTC flag must be off.                                                                                                                                         |

The order error response is given when the entered order is rejected by the trading system. The reason for the rejection is given by Error Code.

## Order Confirmation Response

Successful order entry results in Order Confirmation Response. The confirmed order is returned to the user. When the entered order goes for a freeze and that freeze is approved, this same transaction code is sent. This can be an unsolicited message as well. The message sent is as follows:

## Order Modification Confirmation Response

Successful modification of the order results in Order Modification Confirmation. When the order modification is confirmed, the order-modified time is filled and sent back. On modification, the order can result in a freeze. If the freeze is approved, order modification will be received as an 'Unsolicited Message'.

Unmatched ATO/ Limit Pre-open orders are carried forward to the Normal Market without any change in time priority. For unmatched ATO orders which are carried forward, derived price will be  assigned,  response for  these  orders  will  be  sent  to  traders  as  'Unsolicited'  modification response.

Unmatched Limit Pre-open orders are cancelled or carried forward to the Normal Market without any change in time priority for IPO/Relisting securities.

Unmatched limit Pre-open orders are carried forward to the next session without any change in time priority for illiquid securities

## Chapter 6 Bhav Copy

## Introduction

This section describes the end of the trading day activities. It covers the transmission of Security Bhav Copy and Index Bhav Copy.  This takes place after the markets close for the day. Broadly, the following activities are done:

- Calculation of closing price and generation of interim bhav copy (from 3.30 PM to 3. 40 PM).
- Generation of main bhav-copy will be after 4.00 PM.

Closing Batch: In closing batch, the closing price is calculated and broadcast to the traders. The interim bhav copy is also broadcast to the traders. During closing session traders can trade at the closing price.

Closing Session: After closing batch, the market is open for trading for 20 mins. This period is known as Closing Session . Traders can place orders at market price (closing price) only. Some of error codes have been introduced for closing session. Refer List of Error Codes for the same.

## Chapter 7 Broadcast

## Introduction

This section describes the Compression and Decompression algorithm of Broadcast data and the various Broadcast messages with their structures.

## Compression of the Broadcast Data

The broadcast traffic from the exchange which gives the on-line quotes to the trading terminals has  been  continually  increasing,  especially  during  market  open  and  market  close.  To accommodate the increased broadcast traffic, the exchange has come up with a compression algorithm to compress some of the specific broadcast transaction codes, which are as follows:

|   Transaction Code | Represents                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
|               7201 | Mkt Watch                           |
|              18703 | Ticker                              |
|               7208 | Only MBP                            |
|               7214 | Call AuctionMBP                     |
|               7215 | BROADCAST CALL AUCTION MARKET WATCH |
|               7210 | Order Cancel Update                 |

LZO  compression  algorithm  is  used  to  compress  the  above  specified  broadcast  transaction codes. The details of the LZO compression algorithm are described below.

The LZO stands for Lempel Ziv Oberhaumer. This algorithm is freely available on the internet (URL:  http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo).  It  is  made  available  by  free  software foundation. The algorithm is tested on various operating systems like UNIX and red hat Linux.

## Decompression Routine

## Sequential Packing

To  improve  the  effective  data  transfer,  the  idea  of  sequential  packing  along  with  the  lzo compression algorithm has been incorporated. At the host end, sequential packing algorithm packs the incoming data packets, which is then transmitted over the network. The data packets are packed in FIFO order.

For example,

If 'n' packets are packed in a buffer, they are arranged in the following order:

<!-- image -->

1 st packet will be stored at the first place in the buffer, 2 nd  Packet will be stored at the second place, and so on.

At the front end while de packing the buffer, the packets are to be segregated in the same order, that is, isolate each packet and process each packet as per the sequence viz- first packet first and last packet at the end. The packets within a buffer may be an admixture of compressed and uncompressed data packets.

<!-- image -->

## Calling Convention

The decompression routine is a C-callable routine with the following prototype: Void Sigdec2 (char *ip, unsigned short  *ipL,

char *op, unsigned short *opL,

unsigned short *errorcode);

## Parameters

Ip: it is the pointer to the input buffer.

IpL: It is the pointer to a short containing the length of input.

Op: it is the pointer of the output buffer.

OpL: It is the pointer to a short containing the length of output.

ErrorCode: it is the pointer to a short containing the error code.

<!-- image -->

## Packet Format

Incoming packet at the front end can be interpreted by mapping onto the following structure.

```
Struct { CHAR   cNetId [2] SHORT iNoPackets CHAR   cPackData [512] }     BcastPackData where, cNetId[2] Identifies the machine ( CM broadcast or F&O Broadcast ) Please find different values of CNetId for difference segments Equity: - 4 Equity Derivative: - 2 Currency Derivative: - 6 iNoPackets The number of packets that are sequentially packed cPackData Buffer containing all the packets. The buffer when mapped to, by the above structure, the number of packets in the buffer can be known. The next task is to segregate the packets and process the individual packets. The packets received through the broadcast traffic have to be interpreted as follows COMPRESSION_BROADCAST_DATA { SHORT CompressionLen CHAR BroadcastData [ ]
```

```
}
```

## Note:

- The  first  two  bytes  of  the  broadcast  packet  indicate  the  length  of  the  data  after compression.
- If the compression length is zero, the data received is not compressed.
- If the length is non-zero, the data following the length should be decompressed by using the decompression routine.
- Inside the broadcast data, the first 8 bytes before the message header should be ignored. The message header starts from the 9 th  byte.

<!-- image -->

## Implementation at Front End

The lzo directory (lzo1.07) contains all the lzo source, header and library files. These files are to be included while building an application.

lzo1z\_decompress is used for decompression. This is a function of the lzo library.

An API has to be developed to encompass the above LZO decompression function.

The syntax of the call should be:

lzo\_decomp (char* inp\_buff, unsigned int* inp\_len, char* buffer\_decomp, unsigned int *output\_len, unsigned short *errorCode)

Where,  lzo\_decomp  is  a  function  of  the  API  (to  be  developed  by  referring  to  the  examples specified in the lzo 1.07 directory) that calls the lzo function for decompression 'lzo1z\_decompress'

Inp\_buff

Specifies the input buffer (Compressed Buffer)

Inp\_len

Specifies the length of input buffer (Compressed Length)

Buffer\_decomp Specifies the Buffer after decompression

output\_len

Specifies the  length after decompression ( Output length )

errorCode

Specifies the error code

The syntax of the lzo decompress function is as follows:

lzo1z\_decompress (out, decomp\_inlen, in, &amp; decomp\_outlen, NULL)

Where

out

Specifies input  compressed buffer

decomp\_inlen     Specifies the input length of the buffer ( Length of Compressed buffer )

in

Specifies the output  (decompressed)  buffer

decomp\_outlen   Specifies the output length of the decompressed buffer

## Note:

Inside the broadcast data, the first byte indicates the market type.  Ignore the rest of the 7 bytes before message header. If the first byte has the value of '4', it is Capital market and if it is '2' then it is futures and options market.

The message header starts from 9 th  byte.

## CALL AUCTION MBP Broadcast

During Call Auction2 pre-open session, market data will b BROADCAST CALL AUCTION MBP e sent based on the order activity during the order collection period. Indicative opening price will be computed based on the order activity. When Call Auction2 pre-open session ends, order activity will be stopped and the final open price will be computed for all Call-Auction2 securities. Final open price will be available in the market data.

After computation of final open price, orders will be matched based on the final open price.

Trades related data will be available in market data once the matching is started.

Once the FOP is calculated and matching is over for a token, the MBP data for that token will be received in the existing MBP broadcast packet (7208).

The transaction code to disseminate the Call Auction2 market data during Preopen session is BCAST\_CALL AUCTION\_MBP (7214).

## Chapter 9 Encryption Decryption of Interactive Messages

## Background

NSE provides a pan-India trading platform to its trading members. Members connect to this platform  using  client-server  architecture.  Connections  are  made  using  TCP/IP  protocol  and messages  are  exchanged  using  NSE's  own  messaging  format  (also  known  as  NNF  f ormat). Messages  exchanged  are  binary  in  nature.  Currently  these  messages  are  not  encrypted, exchange now proposes to encrypt them. This section of document provides an overview of the implementation approach that exchange has finalized, for doing the same.

## Overview

Interactive messages which are exchanged between member applications and the exchange today use the NNF protocol published by exchange. As for every trading platform, similarly in this case as well availability, reliability and speed are the key considerations in the protocol. In order to enhance the security posture, it is now proposed to encrypt these messages on an endto-end basis. While encryption of messages within member environment towards their clients will  need  to  be  done  by  respective  members. For the communication that happens between member  applications  and  exchange,  a  few  changes  into  NNF  protocol  are  being  proposed. Changes have been envisaged considering the following attributes.

- (i) Secure communication
- (ii) Availability
- (iii) Reliability
- (iv) Speed

Minimal changes in member applications

## Proposed Methodology

Exchange  proposes  a  combination  of  TLS  1.3  security  protocol  and  AES-256  bits-based symmetric encryption approach. Following is an overview.

<!-- image -->

1 st  Step: Member applications will connect initially to Exchange Gateway Router server using TCP  with  TLS  1.3  security  protocol  and  will  receive  unique  session  key  from  the  Exchange through the secured connection.

2 nd  Step: Member applications will then connect to allocated Exchange Gateway server through TCP,  and each  and  every  message  will  be  encrypted/decrypted  using  the  same  session key (symmetric cryptography AES 256 bits GCM mode) at both member end and Exchange end.

## Below are the details of the methodology

- (i) Exchange will generate self-signed CA certificates on periodic basis. CA certificate will remain common for all members and shall be distributed as and when generated via extranet.
- (ii) On a daily basis when member applications need to connect to trading platform they will need to do the following
- a. Member applications will connect to Exchange Gateway Router server on TCP using  TLS  1.3  security  protocol.  As  part  of  TLS  1.3  security  protocol,  it  is recommended that member applications verify Gateway Router server authenticity using the CA certificate provided by the Exchange.
- b. GR request  and  GR  response  messages  will  be  sent  and  received  by  member applications using TLS 1.3 security protocol.
- c. A unique 32-byte session key will be provided to member applications as part of GR response message.
- (iii) Post successful communication with Gateway router server, member applications will establish a new TCP connection with the allocated gateway server of Exchange. The  first  message  after  connecting  through  TCP  will  be  a  non-encrypted  special registration  message  (SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_REQUEST)  to  indicate  that member application is using encryption. All the messages, after the first message, that are exchanged on this connection from both sides (member applications and Exchange) will be encrypted and decrypted using the 32-byte session key that was

<!-- image -->

provided from Exchange at the time of Gateway Router handshake. GCM mode of symmetric  cryptography  AES  256  bits  will  be  used  by  member  applications  and Exchange.

- (iv) In case of new login or disconnection and then re login, the above-mentioned steps will be repeated

We envisage minimal changes in member applications. Sample function calls which could be considered for encryption-decryption for the above proposed approaches are provided in annexure for Encryption/Decryption.

## Disconnection on MD5 Checksum failure

- (i) If member is connected on encrypted channel and MD5 checksum fails then a box sign off message with error code (19031) will be sent to member before disconnection.
- (ii) If member is connected on non-encrypted channel and MD5 checksum fails then there will be no change in the behavior. The packet will be dropped by Trading system and continue reading the next packet.

## Chapter 10 Direct Interface to Exchange Trading System

This chapter describes how member systems can directly connect to NSE for trading, while using existing formats of business messages from NNF API documents.

To directly connect to NSE for trading, member systems will have carry out the changes specified herein.

## Message Formats

Change to packet format

| Length    | Sequence   | Checksum(MD5) for   | Message Data      |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| (2 bytes) | number     | Message data        | (Variable length) |
|           | (4 bytes)  | (16 bytes)          |                   |

- Max length will be the predefined value of 1024 bytes.

Length = size of length field (2 bytes) +

size of sequence number field (4 bytes) +

size of the checksum field (16 bytes) +

size of Message data (variable number of bytes as per the transcode)

- For  members  connecting  on  encrypted  mode,  the  sequence  number  received  in  the request  message  for  Order  related  interactive  messages  will  be  echoed  back  in  the sequence number field of corresponding response messages. It is recommended to send an incremental sequence number.
- For  members  connecting  on  non-encrypted  mode,  there  is  no  change  in  sequence number. Sequence number will be sent as 0 in all the packets.
- Message data will be of variable length
- The checksum algorithm used will be MD5. Checksum is applied only on the Message data field and not on the entire packet.
- For more details on MD5 refer: RFC 1321 (rfc1321) - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm ()
- In case checksum is not matched, packet will be dropped at Exchange end

## Change to structure for 'MESSAGE\_HEADER'

## MESSAGE\_HEADER

| Structure Name   | MESSAGE_HEADER   | MESSAGE_HEADER   | MESSAGE_HEADER   |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Packet Length    | 40 bytes         | 40 bytes         | 40 bytes         |
| Field Name       | Data Type        | Size in Byte     | Offset           |
| Transaction Code | SHORT            | 2                | 0                |

| User Id          | LONG             | 4                | 8                |
| ErrorCode        | SHORT            | 2                | 12               |
| Timestamp        | LONG LONG        | 8                | 14               |
| TimeStamp1       | CHAR             | 8                | 22               |
| TimeStamp2       | CHAR             | 8                | 30               |
| MessageLength    | SHORT            | 2                | 38               |

Note: Member systems must populate relevant User ID field in the header.

## Connecting to NSE for Trading

## Sequence to be followed by the member for login

1. Member to connect (TCP/IP, SSL connection) to the IP and port provided by the exchange and send the GR\_REQUEST using OpenSSL (Version 1.1.1) library calls with TLS versions 1.3 (TLS1\_3\_VERSION). Refer annexure for Encryption/Decryption.
2. Exchange will send the GR\_RESPONSE to the member containing the IP address, Port and the Session key and cryptographic key  &amp; cryptographic IV (Initialization Vector) on SSL connection. If there is any error, then ErrorCode field in MESSAGE\_HEADER will be populated with relevant error code in the GR\_RESPONSE.
3. Member applications will then make a new TCP connection with the allocated Gateway server (IP and port provided in the GR\_RESPONSE) and send SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_REQUEST. BoxID (received in GR\_RESPONSE) is to be populated in SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_REQUEST

<!-- image -->

4. Exchange will send the SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_RESPONSE. If there is any error, then ErrorCode field in MESSAGE\_HEADER will be populated with relevant error code in the SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_RESPONSE and the Box connection will be terminated.
5. If  there  is  no  error  in  SECURE\_BOX\_REGISTRATION\_RESPONSE,  member  should  do encryption  and  decryption  initialization  to  create  encryption  and  decryption  contexts (Please refer annexure). This initialization should be done only once. Once initialized, all further  messages between member application and allocated Gateway server will be encrypted and decrypted using same encryption and decryption contexts respectively. Further member should send the BOX\_SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_IN. BoxID, BrokerID and Session key (received in GR\_RESPONSE) is to be populated in BOX\_SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_IN. MD5 Algorithm to be performed on plain messages. That means, while sending the messages to Trading system, MD5 is to be performed first and then encryption. Encrypted message length + 22 (sizeof(Header)) will have to be written in  first  2  bytes  of  header,  Sequence  Number in next 4 bytes and MD5 value (of plain message)  will  be  written  in  last  16  bytes  of  Header  and  the  header  will  have  to  be prepended to the encrypted message. This message will be sent out to Trading System. While receiving the messages from Trading System, decryption should be done first and then MD5 is to be applied on decrypted buffer. Decryption should be done on message excluding first 22 bytes of header.
6. Exchange  will  send  the  BOX\_SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_OUT.  If  there  is  any  error,  then ErrorCode field in MESSAGE\_HEADER will be populated with relevant error code in the BOX\_SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_OUT and the Box connection will be terminated. Note: Multiple BOX\_SIGN\_ON\_REQUEST\_IN requests on a successfully established box
4. connection will lead to the existing box connection termination.
7. Once a connection for a particular Box ID is established, all users linked with this Box ID can login using the SIGNON\_IN structure. Refer Chapter 3 for login request and response using SIGNON\_IN structure.

Note: Rest of the fields of SIGNON IN to be populated as prescribed in Chapter 3 of protocol document.

If authentication information is correct, member systems will receive a successful SIGNON\_OUT response.

## How to Logoff?

To logoff from the exchange trading system, there is no change and use the existing protocol defined in Chapter 3 of protocol document.

## Heartbeat exchange

Member systems must exchange heartbeat signals with exchange trading system during periods of  inactivity.  Trading  Host  will  consider  the  member  system  as  inactive  after  missing  two heartbeats in succession and disconnect the socket connection. Heartbeats will carry following data in MessageData segment of the message. Heartbeat is to be sent only if there is inactivity for 30 seconds. The format is MESSAGE\_HEADER with following detail.

## Recovering from disconnections

If member system detects a loss of TCP connection with the exchange trading system, please perform the same operations for starting a fresh login given above.

## Performing Trading activities

Once  authenticated  connection  is  successfully  established,  member  systems  can  send  any business message to exchange as described in NNF protocol documents. Care should be taken to use MESSAGE\_HEADER described in this chapter wherever applicable in front of business messages.

## Connection Termination

When  connection is terminated by exchange,  BOX\_SIGN\_OFF  (20322)  message  with appropriate error code will be sent.

## Chapter 11 Exception Handling

## Introduction

NSE's trading system constitutes of multiple matching engines (streams). Each stream hosts a range of contracts on which trading is allowed. In case of an exception single/multiple streams will get impacted. It is necessary that relevant information is disseminated in such events so that necessary action can be taken at member's end to bring their systems into a consistent state. Exception handling:

1. At the start of the outage message will be sent on broadcast channel with StreamNumber and status as 1 (start of outage) and members may get disconnected from the exchange (Member can also receive this message through journal download).
2. On receiving message in step 1, members should clear outstanding orders at their end for the respective streams. Exchange would also cancel all the outstanding orders and no cancellation messages will be sent for these orders.
3. Once exchange has restored the stream, message will be sent on broadcast channel with StreamNumber and status as 0 (end of outage) (Member can also receive this message through journal download).
4. On receiving the message in step 3, Members can reconnect to the exchange in case they have got disconnected in step 1.

## Message structure

Message structure is as follows:

## Annexure for Encryption/Decryption

## Sr. No. The following are sample function calls of OpenSSL library in Linux (for reference) 1 Note -

- Openssl Library version used is OpenSSL 1.1.1.
- TLS protocol version has been set to 1.3 (TLS1\_3\_VERSION).

Following are the system library calls for TLS1.3-

## SSL/TLS library initialization â

1. SSL\_library\_init () - Initialize SSL library by registering algorithms.
2. OpenSSL\_add\_all\_algorithms ()  -  Adds  all  algorithms  to  the  table  (digests  and ciphers)
3. SSL\_load\_error\_strings () - Registers the error strings for all libcrypto and libssl error strings.
4. SSL\_CTX\_new ( TLS\_client\_method ()) - Create a new SSL\_CTX object as framework for TLS/SSL enabled functions.
5. SSL\_CTX\_set\_min\_proto\_version (SSL\_CTX  *ctx,  int  version)  -  Set  the  minimum protocol versions to TLS1\_3\_VERSION.
6. SSL\_CTX\_set\_max\_proto\_version (SSL\_CTX  *ctx,  int  version)  -  Set  the  maximum protocol versions to TLS1\_3\_VERSION.

## Establishing the SSL/TLS connection â

1. socket (PF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM, 0) - Create TCP socket.
2. connect (int  sockfd,  const  struct  sockaddr  *addr,  socklen\_t  addrlen)  -  Initiate  the TCP/IP connection with server.
3. SSL\_new (SSL\_CTX *ctx) - Create new SSL connection state.
4. SSL\_set\_fd (SSL *ssl, int fd) - Attach the socket descriptor.
5. SSL\_connect (SSL *ssl) - Perform the SSL connection.

## Validating the Gateway Router server certificate â

1. SSL\_get\_peer\_certificate (const SSL *ssl) - Get the server's certificate.
2. X509\_STORE\_new () - This function returns a new X509\_STORE.
3. X509\_STORE\_CTX\_new () -This function returns a newly initialised X509\_STORE\_CTX.

<!-- image -->

4. X509\_STORE\_load\_locations (X509\_STORE *ctx, const char *file, const char *dir) Configure files and directories used by a certificate store. The path of CA certificate (gr\_ca\_cert1.pem) will be used in this function. The CA certificate (gr\_ca\_cert1.pem) will be provided by the Exchange for validation of Gateway Router certificate.
5. X509\_STORE\_CTX\_init (X509\_STORE\_CTX  *ctx,  X509\_STORE  *trust\_store,  X509 *target,  STACK\_OF(X509)  *untrusted)  -  This  function  returns  a  newly  initialised X509\_STORE\_CTX structure.
6. X509\_verify\_cert (X509\_STORE\_CTX  *ctx)  -  This  function  builds  and  verify  X509 certificate chain.

## Send and Receive messages on SSL/TLS connection â

1. SSL\_write (SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num) - Send message on SSL.
2. SSL\_read (SSL *ssl, void *buf, int num) - Receive message from SSL.

## 2 For symmetric encryption/decryption methodology -

```
Encryption: Initialization â void encrypt_EVP_aes_256_cbc_init(EVP_CIPHER_CTX **ctx, unsigned char *key, unsigned char *iv) { if(!(*ctx = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new() )) handleErrors(); if(1 != EVP_EncryptInit_ex (*ctx , EVP_aes_256_gcm() , NULL, key, iv)) handleErrors(); } Encryption â void encrypt(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *plaintext, int plaintext_len, unsigned char *ciphertext, int *ciphertext_len) { int len;
```
